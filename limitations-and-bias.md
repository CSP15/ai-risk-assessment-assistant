# Limitations & Ethical Considerations

## Bias & Model Drift
- Generative models can misclassify inputs or over/underestimate risk impact.

## Hallucination Risk
- Outputs must be reviewed by human experts before action is taken.

## Data Sensitivity
- Ensure no PII is input into public AI tools. Anonymise inputs if using external APIs.

## Compliance
- This tool does not replace formal risk registers or certified assessments.
