# Concept â€“ Zapier Integration with Notion

This assistant can trigger Notion pages via Zapier based on risk inputs.

## Example Workflow:
- User inputs risk via Google Form
- Zapier captures input and passes it to OpenAI API
- Processed output is stored in a Notion database with:
  - Risk domain
  - Severity
  - Action points
  - Date logged
